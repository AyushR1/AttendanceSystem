# ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The current system to log attendance in RGIPT is not digital. Faculties still use the conventional way of maintaining a register to log attendance. This project aims to digitize the whole system to log attendance with the necessary features required for students and faculties

Student Database related queries like finding students on the verge of debarring or finding a certain percentage of attendance are easy to do so without manual calculations
